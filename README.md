## 1. Fibonacci Sequence

Problem defination:

```bash
Give a number 'n', find the first 'n' elements of the fibonacci sequence.

In mathmatics, the fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two 
preceding ones The first two numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1.

fibonacci(2) = [0, 1]

fibonacci(3) = [0, 1, 1]
`NB: here third number is sum of first 2 number`

fibonacci(7) = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]

[x] Big O = O(n)
[x] Linear time complexity
